# BoostPOW 3D Renderer

This project is a 3D renderer that showcases objects with Boost Proof-of-Work (BoostPOW) attached, as described by Daniel Krawisz. The sizes of the objects are based on the difficulty of the BoostPOW, and the text is inspired by the "Writing in the Sky" cartoon created by the project's creator.

## Technologies Used

The BoostPOW 3D Renderer project utilizes the following technologies:

- [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org): A Vue.js framework for building server-side rendered and static websites.
- [TresJS](https://tres.js.org): A 3D rendering engine based on WebGL and Three.js, providing powerful tools for creating interactive 3D experiences.

## Project Setup

To get started with the BoostPOW 3D Renderer, follow the steps below:

1. Install the project dependencies using your preferred package manager:

   ```bash
   # npm
   npm install

   # pnpm
   pnpm install

   # yarn
   yarn install
   ```

2. Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

   ```bash
   # npm
   npm run dev

   # pnpm
   pnpm run dev

   # yarn
   yarn dev
   ```

## Building for Production

To build the BoostPOW 3D Renderer for production, use the following command:

```bash
# npm
npm run build

# pnpm
pnpm run build

# yarn
yarn build
```

To preview the production build locally, use the following command:

```bash
# npm
npm run preview

# pnpm
pnpm run preview
